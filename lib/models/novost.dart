    name: 'Panenka - the penalty that killed a career and started a feud',
    body:
        "In the end, the Germans' eagerness to go on holiday changed history.\n\nTheir Euro 1976 final against Czechoslovakia was never meant to go to penalties.\n\nWest Germany - defending European champions, reigning World Cup winners - were heavy favourites.\n\nEven if Czechoslovakia held out through extra time, the initial plan had been for a replay two days later. Welsh referee Clive Thomas had been told to delay his return home from host nation Yugoslavia to cover the eventuality.\n\nA few hours before the match though, the plan changed.\n\n\"It was a request from the German Football Association,\" remembers Antonin Panenka.\n\n\"They said that their players had already booked some holidays, blah, blah, blah, and asked if penalties could be taken straight away instead of a replay.\"\n\nCzechoslovakia figured, as underdogs, they were more likely to prevail in a shoot-out than a second match, so they agreed.\n\nPanenka, an elegant, passing playmaker, mentally checked his plan once more.\n\nAll was in order. No alteration necessary, no doubt admitted.\n\nA ploy two years in the making that would make him famous and infamous, a hero and an enemy - whether it succeeded or not - was ready. Back home, Panenka had been involved in another, almost daily, penalty contest.\n\nAfter training at his Prague club side Bohemians, Panenka and goalkeeper Zdenek Hruska would stay behind to practise spot-kicks.\n\nIt was a very personal duel. Panenka would have five penalties - he would have to score all five, Hruska would have to save just one. Whoever lost would buy their post-training beer or chocolate.\n\n\"I was constantly paying him,\" says Panenka.\n\n\"So in the evenings I would think up ways to beat him - that's when I realised that as I ran up the goalkeeper would wait for the last second and then gamble, diving to the left or the right.\n\n\"I thought: 'What if I send the ball almost directly into the centre of the goal?'\"\n\nPanenka tried it. He found that introducing another possible penalty and some hesitation to Hruska's mind meant he was winning more, spending less and still getting his post-training treat.\n\nIt could have stopped there and remained a piece of unseen showboating. But Panenka realised his new technique was more than that. He had unearthed a legitimate 12-yard tactic.\n\nOver the next couple of years, he tested it on larger and larger stages. First, in training, then in friendlies and finally, the month before Euro 1976, against local rivals Dukla Prague in a competitive fixture.\n\nEach time it worked and his conviction grew.\n\n\"I made no secret of it,\" Panenka says.\n\n\"Here [in Czechoslovakia] people were well aware of it.\n\n\"But in western countries, in top football countries nobody was interested in Czechoslovak football at all.\n\n\"Maybe they were kept up with some results, but they didn't watch our games.\"\n\nSo, there was no laminated cheat sheet or whispered instructions from a backroom analyst for Sepp Maier.\n\nAs the West German goalkeeper crouched on his goalline and fixed his eyes on Panenka, he had only his own instincts to go on.\n\nMaier's team-mate Uli Hoeness had blazed the previous spot-kick over the bar. It was the first miss of the shoot-out, after extra time finished with the teams still locked together at 2-2.\n\nInstantly the stakes became sudden death and sky high. If Panenka scored, West Germany were beaten.\n\nPanenka's run-up was long and fast. He seemed intent, like Hoeness, on thumping his instep through the back of the ball.\n\nInstead, with the most important kick of his life, he fell back on his trusted trick. A deft tickle sent the ball floating down the centre of the goal. Panenka's arm was aloft in celebration before it hit the net. Maier, flummoxed and failing, scrambled back to his feet, but only in time to shoot a rueful look at Panenka wheeling away in celebration.\n\n\"None of us could believe we were European champions,\" said Panenka. \"It was like Alice in Wonderland.\"\n\nIt was just as surreal back in Prague. Their European Championship win came eight years after the Prague Spring - when a Soviet-led herd of tanks had rolled across the border and crushed attempts to loosen the country's communist system.\n\nSince then, large public gatherings had been rare, permitted only for orchestrated welcomes of foreign dignitaries. When the team arrived with Czechoslovakia though, there was no holding back the emotion or the numbers.\n\n\"Nobody expected that so many people would come to give us such a warm welcome,\" Panenka remembers.\n\n\"When some head of state came, the roads used to be lined with young people holding parade wands.\n\n\"But it was all sort of forced. This time though they all came spontaneously to greet us and show their appreciation. I had never experienced anything like that before. It was one of the best moments of my football career.\"\n\nPanenka's decisive, distinctive penalty made him centre of attention. Not just for the crowd, but for the authorities as well.\n\nCzechoslovakians had been subjected to a process dubbed 'normalisation' since their attempt to diverge from the Soviet model. The remoulding or removing of dissident elements had gone far beyond politics.\n\nJust three months before Euro 1976, Czechoslovakia's secret police had arrested a psychedelic rock band and other underground musicians, fearful that long hair and counter-cultural lyrics alone could fuel revolution.",

        'Three and easy: which footballers have scored a hat-trick of penalties?',
    body:
        "“Justin Kluivert scored a hat-trick of penalties for Bournemouth at Wolves. Who else has achieved this and who was the last player to do it in the English top flight?” asks Robbie Considine.\n\nKluivert’s hat-trick of penalties was the first in Premier League history and the first in the English top flight for 67 years. In December 1957, Manchester City’s Ken Barnes did the necessary three times in a big win over Everton. “No other explanation of Manchester City’s drastic 6-2 defeat of Everton at Moss Side, Manchester, on Saturday is possible except that of sheer brilliance,” wrote the Manchester Guardian’s correspondent. “Barnes had the unusual experience of scoring three goals – all from penalties. What is more, he seized the occasion to demonstrate how easily a goalkeeper may be beaten by the silkiest, gentlest of kicks, provided due regard is paid to placing.”\n\nBarnes and Kluivert are members of an elite club that has only two other members. Billy Walker scored three penalties in Aston Villa’s 7-1 victory over Bradford in 1921-22, and Villa were on the receiving end when Charlie Mitten did likewise for Manchester United in 1949-50. Mitten went one better by scoring from open play to give him four in the match; Manchester United won 7-0.\n\nThere are some more famous examples in other competitions, including two in the League Cup in the mid-1980s. Scottish midfielder Andy Blair scored three for Sheffield Wednesday in a 4-2 win over Luton in November 1984, a feat that stood out even more because Wednesday had already missed three penalties that season.\n\nTwo years later, Jan Molby repeated the feat for Liverpool in a 3-1 win over Coventry at Anfield – and then scored another penalty against them in the league three days later.\n\nIn 1989, Scotland hosted the Under-16 World Cup and reached the final before losing to Saudi Arabia on penalties. The tournament was a pretty big deal and was even featured on Saint & Greavsie. Earlier in the tournament, at Hampden Park no less, Bahrain’s Khaled Jasem scored all of their goals from the spot in a 3-0 win over Cuba.\n\nYou almost certainly don’t remember that, but you might recall the next example. In June 2004, Brazil beat Argentina 3-1 in a World Cup qualifier thanks to a hat-trick of penalties from Ronaldo. According to the International Federation of Football History and Statistics, there has been only one hat-trick of penalties in senior football at an actual tournament rather than during qualification. That was in February’s Asian Cup final: Jordan 1-3 Qatar, or Jordan 1-3 Akram Afif.\n\nLast, and emphatically least, most of you will remember Argentina’s Martín Palermo missing a hat-trick of penalties against Colombia during the 1999 Copa América. At least, as the accompanying photo shows, the Colombia players showed sympathy for their fellow man.",

    body:
        "“As an inveterate text reader, I cannot help absorbing the fragments of black-on-red text in the [background on the] Missing Words round on Have I Got News For You,” writes Tom Whiteley. “Can anyone name the West Brom match that is mentioned?”\n\nWe think we know the answer, so please allow us to indulge our inner Poirot and take it clue by clue.\n\nClue 1: ‘Bob Tay… shot West Brom’ This almost certainly means Bob Taylor scored a goal, and it’s an entirely useless clue: he hit over 130 for West Brom in two spells between 1992 and 2003.\n\nClue 2: ‘Micky Mell’ Now we’re talking. This refers to Micky Mellon, who joined West Brom halfway through the 1992-93 season and was only with the club for about 18 months.\n\nClue 3: ‘hopeful of prom’ This isn’t American Pie, so we’re pretty sure it means West Brom were hopeful of promotion. It’s fair to assume that wasn’t the case in 1993-94, when they only avoided relegation on goal difference. The season before, however, they were chasing promotion from the third tier, which means this game took place between January and May 1993. The net is closing!\n\nClue 4: ‘in front with a se… half penalty’ Taylor’s goal was a second-half penalty that put West Brom in front. After consulting our oldest friend, Rothmans Football Yearbook, we know Taylor scored three penalties in the second half of the 1992-93 season: a 4-0 win at home to Fulham, a 3-1 defeat at Brighton and a 2-2 draw at Bradford.\n\nIt can’t be the Fulham game because the text refers to a fightback. It also refers to a ‘coast side’, and at this point we’re feeling smug enough to suggest the preceding word is ‘south’.\n\nWe can therefore announce that the killer match in question is none other than Brighton & Hove Albion 3-1 West Bromwich Albion in the old Division Two on Wednesday 10 March 1993.\n\nA look through the archives, specifically the Worthing Herald, confirms as much.\n\nWest Brom went ahead just after half-time when keeper Mark Beeney felled Micky Mellon and Bob Taylor scored the perfect penalty.\n\nWhat HIGNFY doesn’t tell us is that it was a costly defeat for West Brom, whose season was in danger of petering out. Their manager Ossie Ardiles said they were “soft touches” and that he’d clear out the experienced players if they weren’t promoted. The threat worked. Albion finished the season superbly and went up after beating Port Vale 3-0 in the playoff final.",

    name: 'What is the heaviest defeat to end a long unbeaten run in football?',
    body:
        "“Aberdeen were thrashed 6-0 by Celtic in the Scottish League Cup, ending a 16-match unbeaten run under Jimmy Thelin. What’s the heaviest defeat to end an unbeaten run?” asked Matthew Shore last week.\n\nWe added the caveat of an unbeaten run of at least 15 games, and Chris Roe got busy crunching the numbers, for English football at least. “There have been 487 instances of unbeaten runs in league fixtures of at least 15 matches in length,” he tells us. “Of those, 290 were ended by a single-goal defeat, and 133 by a two-goal margin.”\n\n“The first Football League team to lose their unbeaten run in a defeat by three goals was Preston North End in 1891-92. After a run of 14 wins and one draw, they lost 4-1 to Sunderland on 12 March 1892. Grimsby Town eclipsed that in 1900-01, when their 17-game run was ended by a 5-0 defeat to New Brighton Tower.”\n\nAs Daniel Seppings also reported, there are three other teams to lose unbeaten runs with a five-goal defeat, and one is slightly more memorable than the others: Northampton Town (lost 5-0 to Newcastle, 1964-65), Swansea City (lost 5-0 to Luton, 1979-80) … and Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United, who were thumped 5-0 at Chelsea in October 1999 to end a 29-game unbeaten league run.\n\nJeremy Simmonds points out that in 1977-78, “Everton lost their opening two matches then went unbeaten for 18 games, before conceding six at home to Manchester United on Boxing Day. They did, however, get on the scoresheet twice themselves.” It finished 6-2 to United, and as Scott Murray writes here, the shattered Toffees went on to lose 3-1 at Leeds just 24 hours later.\n\nFinally, as both Chris and Daniel highlight, there is an English team with a 25-game unbeaten league run who suffered a 7-0 defeat. Step forward Nottingham Forest, whose run across two seasons from February to November 1995 was ended in ruthless fashion by the reigning Premier League champions, Blackburn Rovers.\n\nHeading south\n\n“With seven London teams and three on the south coast, is this season the least ‘northern’ in English top-flight history?” asks Tim P.\n\n“The short answer is yes, that is correct!!” writes Daniel Seppings, stopping at a disappointing two exclamation marks. “Using Ordnance Survey coordinates for every ground ever used in an English top-flight match, I’ve worked out the average number of miles north a match has been played. For 2024-25, the average distance north of a Premier League match has been 161.4 miles.\n\n“The record before this season was 1987-88, when the average distance north was 162.6 miles and the top division featured seven London teams as well as Oxford, Luton, Watford, Portsmouth and Southampton. The most northerly top-flight season was 1902-03 where the average distance north was 244.9 miles. The league this season featured no teams south of the Midlands.”\n\nFour-midable title winners\n\nLast week, Ralph Neville asked: “Sean Gannon has just won his 11th League of Ireland trophy with his fourth club (Shelbourne). Has any other player won the same league with four or more different clubs previously?”\n\nPete Tomlin offers a comprehensive answer. “According to my research, there are nine players who have achieved this feat. The first to do so was Alain Geiger, a centre-back who won the Swiss Nationalliga in 1984-85 with Servette, in 1987-88 with Neuchâtel Xamax, in 1991-92 with Sion and finally in 1995-96 with Grasshopper Zurich.”",

        'The greatest Liverpool squad ever? When Nicol scored three at Newcastle',
    body:
        "Sunday 20 September 1987. The First Division season has only been up and running for a month, yet it is hard not to arrive at a premature conclusion.\n\nFor the millions of viewers watching the BBC’s live coverage of Liverpool’s win at Newcastle, all the evidence points to the fact that the title will once again be going to Anfield.\n\nHindsight shows us that all the kneejerk reactions were right. Ian Rush may have departed, but Kenny Dalglish had dipped into the transfer market to add key parts to his latest machine. John Aldridge had arrived in January 1987, and with Peter Beardsley and John Barnes joining in the summer, Liverpool were well equipped to wrestle the title back from Everton.\n\nThe early signs justified the hype. A 2-1 win at League Cup holders Arsenal was followed up by a 4-1 victory at FA Cup winners Coventry. After drawing at West Ham, Liverpool won their next two at Anfield – a collapsed sewer under the Kop had delayed Liverpool’s home matches at the start of the campaign – as the nation prepared to watch Dalglish’s team take on Newcastle at St James’ Park.\n\nIn truth, Newcastle were in a fragile condition. Losing Beardsley to Liverpool hardly helped the state of their team nor the mood of their fans, and with the West Stand at St James’ Park demolished at the start of the season, a reduced ground capacity of 29,000 did little to improve the atmosphere surrounding the club.\n\nWith their young star Paul Gascoigne injured, all eyes focused squarely on Newcastle’s new Brazilian striker. Signed for £575,000 from Palmeiras, Mirandinha at least provided Newcastle fans with hope. Some Geordies donned sombreros in the Gallowgate End – \"why sombreros?\", as the Guardian’s Stephen Bierley asked – as the first Brazilian to play in English football was welcomed with open arms.\n\nScoring two goals at Old Trafford the week before, the excitement in Newcastle surrounding Mirandinha was understandable. \"We’ve got Mirandinha, he’s not from Argentina. He’s from Brazil, he’s fucking brill,\" soon became a popular chant on the terraces. But realistically, Mirandinha was joining a struggling team, especially with Gascoigne absent, a situation made obvious the following season.\n\nJust one win in the opening six matches saw the pressure grow on Newcastle’s manager, Willie McFaul, although most fans chose to vent their frustrations towards board members. The sale of Beardsley had hurt – he was booed on his return – and the visit of Liverpool inevitably added to the feelings of gloom at the club.\n\nConversely, all was rosy in the Liverpool garden, although moving the match for the purposes of television provided a double-edged sword for one player. Steve Nicol should have been on the Isle of Arran, giving away his twin sister Susan at her wedding. Yet he would have a decent consolation of scoring a hat-trick live on the BBC, as Liverpool coasted to victory.\n\nThe opener after 20 minutes saw Barnes and Beardsley combine down Liverpool’s left, defender John Anderson’s poor clearance falling straight into the path of Nicol. The Scot, playing in right midfield role, slotted home with his left foot to give Liverpool the lead. The rest of the first half was one-way traffic.\n\nNicol almost added a second, with Gary Kelly keeping out his header, and from the resulting corner Aldridge had a goal harshly disallowed for a push. But the striker did find the net in the 37th minute, instinctively flicking home from a Barnes header. Aldridge had scored in his sixth consecutive league match of the season.\n\nThe pressure was relentless. Beardsley went close, Ronnie Whelan tested Kelly from range, and Anderson cleared another Aldridge effort off the line. On a memorable day for Nicol there was one moment of disappointment, when his beautiful left-footed chip was ruled out due to an offside incorrectly awarded against the retreating Aldridge; Anderson, who had originally been sent sprawling by Nicol, was playing everyone onside.\n\nAny hope for an unlikely comeback evaporated shortly into the second half. Beardsley, beating the offside trap, broke into Newcastle’s box before unselfishly squaring to Nicol. With the ball slightly behind him, Nicol mis-hit his effort from just a few yards out, but got enough on it to put the game to bed.\n\nThe only ray of light for home fans arrived on the hour mark, as Mirandinha earned a penalty after a clumsy challenge from Gary Gillespie. Neil McDonald fired past Bruce Grobbelaar, but the feeling of discontent remained. Cries of \"sack the board\" made it clear where the finger of blame was being pointed.",

        "Three days into December and Football Daily has already polished off the advent calendar. The lack of self-discipline and short-sightedness is as astounding as it is predictable and part of the reason we are writing tea-timely emails rather than hoovering up any of the FSA awards, dished out on Monday night to our so-called counterparts. Enjoy the gongs, journalists. I hope they make you happy. Dear Lord, what sad little lives.\n\nChristmas should be a time for joy but for those of us floundering, it can also be a difficult time to negotiate. Just ask Everton fans: fresh from having their tails handed to them at Old Trafford, the club now face a crucial relegation clash at home to Wolves on Wednesday, before a set of festive fixtures trickier than Football Daily’s Christmas lights: the Merseyside derby at home to Liverpool on Saturday, before games against Arsenal, Chelsea and on Boxing Day, Manchester City. That Christmas Day hangover is going to hit different.\n\nAt least the FA Cup third-round draw was relatively kind to the Toffees, who were handed a home tie against Peterborough United to bring in the new year. The mid-table League One side shouldn’t pose any problems to Sean Dyche – assuming he hasn’t already been booted through the large Goodison door marked Do One by that stage, but the game does also throw up the prospect of Ashley Young, 39, playing against his son, Posh forward Tyler, 18. Not only does this mean that there is a cosy, family narrative to this otherwise forgettable game of association football, but also the possibility that Everton fans could suffer further ignominy as their right-back, nearly in his 40s, is given another runaround by his offspring. \"WOW………. Dreams Might Come True #FaCup #GoosebumpsMoment #YoungVsYoung,\" tweeted Young Snr at the news of the draw, seemingly unaware that it could be his son that puts him into retirement.\n\nEverton aren’t the only top-flight team at risk of an upset. In a repeat of this Wednesday’s Premier League clash, Manchester United face the unenviable trip to Arsenal. Could there be anything more Spursy than getting turned over at Tamworth? Will City’s dismal run extend to January, when Salford City cross Manchester to visit the Etihad? Gary Neville, co-owner of the League Two club, will certainly hope so. And Leeds will play neighbours Harrogate Town for the first time in their history. Absolutely mouthwatering, those little advent chocolates. And the FA Cup draw wasn’t bad either. Roll on January.",

        "Arsenal reduced Liverpool’s lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points with a crucial win against Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nAfter Fabian Schär’s late equaliser denied Liverpool victory at St James’ Park, Mikel Arteta’s team were offered the chance to inch closer to the summit.\n\nAnd the Gunners did not disappoint with Jurriën Timber and William Saliba both scoring from corners in the second half to provide the hosts with a win that kept their title hopes alive.\n\nAfter following up a draw at Ipswich with home victories against Bodø/Glimt and Everton, Ruben Amorim warned that his unbeaten start to life at Old Trafford could be unsettled by a “storm”. However, the opening period at the Emirates was a turgid affair. Gabriel Martinelli had the ball in the net after just four minutes but Kai Havertz was clearly offside in the buildup.\n\nA quintet queued up at the far post for one of four Arsenal corners in the first half. The chance arrived at the front post, but Thomas Partey was unable to get anything substantial on Declan Rice’s delivery – the ball dropping harmlessly wide.\n\nArsenal’s best chance of the first period arrived with 30 minutes gone when Martinelli thrashed Oleksandr Zinchenko’s blocked effort wide.\n\nMoments later, the hosts wanted a penalty when Bukayo Saka’s cross struck Harry Maguire on the thigh. Despite Arsenal hogging the chances, the best effort of the first 45 fell to United as Diogo Dalot flashed his shot across David Raya’s goal when he really should have tested the Spaniard.\n\nTwo minutes into the second period and Martinelli had the home crowd on their feet when he found space on the left-hand side, but the Brazilian’s effort deflected off Maguire and into André Onana’s arms. Sixty seconds later and Rice’s shot cannoned off Mason Mount for a corner.\n\nArsenal had signalled their intent and within nine minutes of the second half starting, they had their breakthrough. Timber leaned into Rasmus Højlund at the front post before diverting Rice’s set-piece into the back of Onana’s net. Saka then drew a low save from Onana with the home crowd sensing blood.\n\nOn came the cavalry for United, with Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee – both benched after netting a double each against Everton last Sunday – introduced on the hour mark. And the latter’s first touch nearly ended up in his own net when his header, from another Rice corner, zipped across his own goal.\n\nUnited did not have an answer. The storm Amorim predicted had duly arrived. But against the run of play, the visitors were almost on level terms with 66 minutes gone.\n\nA tired Zinchenko hacked down Amad Diallo, and from the ensuing set-piece, Raya produced a world-class flying save to claw out Matthijs De Ligt’s header with his left claw. And just seven minutes later, Arsenal doubled their advantage.\n\nPartey found himself unmarked at the back post from Saka’s corner, and his header deflected in off Saliba’s shoulder.\n\nIt marked Arsenal’s 22nd goal from a corner since the start of last season. No side in the division can boast more. Arteta and the club’s set-piece guru Nicolas Jover embraced on the touchline as Amorim was left with his head in his hands.\n\nHavertz might have put the game out of sight at the restart only to fire his effort at Onana before the substitute Mikel Merino’s header from Saka’s corner drifted just wide.\n\nBut it did not matter for the Gunners who saw out the three points with ease and condemned Amorim to his first defeat as United boss.",

Only bid not eliminated by a gathering sense of inevitability: Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn the past few weeks the governing body and its chosen surrogate have engaged in a self-described “inspection” process, the results of which will shortly be announced, and which will at least provide a chimera of due process.\n\nAnd so football finds itself standing at the way point, placing its Gibson flat-top down in the dust, running a hand over its gleaming bald pate, listening for the clop of approaching hooves on the express route to Neom and all points south.\n\nFor now, perhaps the most startling aspect is the silence around this process and its likely consequences from almost every national football association. Although not everyone is taking it lying down.\n\nOn Monday, Amnesty International published High Stakes Bids, a report that concludes Saudi’s staging of the 2034 tournament should be immediately halted to avoid the abuses and deaths that seem inevitable under the current set of practices.\n\nTwo weeks ago, FairSquare published its comprehensive study of Fifa’s activities, concluding that football’s governing body is playing a part in “a wide range of social harms, not least very serious and systematic human rights abuses”. Or in other words, that Fifa is not just muddled and misled but an active source of harm, that people are in effect being oppressed, enslaved and killed in its name.\n\nThe most startling aspect to these notes of warning is still how un-startling they seem to be. It is no secret there is a general sense of drift around these issues, a conviction that nothing can be done, despite hard, visceral evidence of the likely outcomes.\n\nAnd make no mistake, these are stark. The recent ITV documentary, Kingdom Uncovered, gave us another number to go with the World Cup bid book’s excitable talk of 11 new stadiums, 185,000 new hotel rooms and Fifa’s estimated 1bn sponsorship deal with Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company.\n\nThat number is 21,000, or the total of Nepali, Bangladeshi and Indian workers reported to have died since the launch of the Vision 2030 programme in April 2016, a process hardly likely to be halted by a World Cup green light.\n\nDeath is not a distant hypothetical at this stage. It’s here in the room with us. We have data from Qatar. We can even make a fair estimate of the total deaths a Saudi tournament will leave in its wake without serious reforms, a calculation presumably factored somewhere into Fifa’s planning, just another part of the bidding algorithm under Gianni Infantino.\n\nThis is something new. Qatar 2022 was at least awarded via a full voting process (stop laughing) to the extent the result went against what the executive wanted at the time, with Sepp Blatter forced to hiss “Smile!” at Jérôme Valcke as they stood on stage at Fifa House looking doomed. For most people the initial response was a baffled shrug. There was nothing like the evidence we have now of what its construction would entail.\n\nBy contrast, Infantino has both executive control and full knowledge of the possible consequences. This isn’t a hijacking. It is instead a considered and managed process. Let us sponsor the building of your hardline leisure state. Let us take the rewards, nourish ourselves on suffering in plain sight, while pretending to an almost satirical degree that it is all for love of the game, that this one’s for the children.\n\nAt which point two things can be said. First, this will stand as surely the most wretched, bloody, damaging act in the history of global organised sport. If not causing death were your starting point, your one non-negotiable, Saudi Arabia wouldn’t even be on the table. And yet Infantino appears to have actively sought this outcome, aligning his Fifa with the world’s most ruthlessly ambitious carbon power; and as a consequence taking choices that will, it can be assumed, cause demonstrable death and suffering.\n\nThis is a structural failing, fruit of Fifa’s laughably antiquated man-from-Del-Monte style of governance. It is also the result of decision-making by a very small circle of people. Never mind the gleamingly messianic persona, the cult-like inner circle (it is always a shock to notice even minor Fifa wonks will go with The Gianni: navy suit, white trainers, weird glassy look). None of this has to happen. Infantino remains, as Miguel Delaney writes in States of Play, “a more or less random man” elevated to a position of ludicrously overblown power without oversight.\n\nPut like this, a second possibility suggests itself. How close, in choosing this path, in failing so far to mitigate the most likely negative outcomes, could Fifa get to committing an act of corporate manslaughter?\n\nWhat we have here is a course of action that will in all probability be associated at one remove with death. The world may have been beaten into a state of apathy. But to what, if any, degree do we have the elements of an actual legal offence here, criminal or civil?\n\nHugh Southey KC, a human rights barrister at Matrix Chambers, says that while the risks of a workable criminal prosecution are “very low”, the issues raised “ought to be a legitimate concern for Fifa”.\n\nAs Southey says, the components of any hypothetical criminal prosecution would be highly specific and necessarily difficult to establish. “There needs to be a gross breach of the duty of care. That is a high threshold. However, in this case there could be an argument made that the threshold was crossed because there are so many red flags and they have been ignored.\n\n“There may be causation issues; for example it may be necessary for a prosecutor to prove that Saudi would not have got the World Cup without the Fifa failings. There will also be jurisdiction issues.”\n\nTo date the prospect remains very distant. No one has stuck a World Cup spade in the ground. There is a great deal of fine Fifa talk about enforcing human rights obligations. And yet, to the layman, it may be hard to avoid the sense of dots waiting to be joined.\n\nAs Stephen Cockburn of Amnesty International says: “Fifa knows that workers are likely to die if they hand the World Cup to Saudi Arabia without putting proper protections in place. They will never be able to say that they were not warned, never be able to say that they did not have a chance to prevent it. As demands for justice and accountability inevitably grow, perhaps one day this fact will become important.”\n\nIn other words, this remains a hypothetical exercise. But how would that hypothesis run exactly? Under UK law the relevant criminal offence must involve the following elements: duty of care to the deceased; a breach of this duty; a chain of causation between breach and harm; and a conclusion that the negligence was “gross”, that it showed such disregard for the life and safety of others that it merits punishment. So what do we know?",

    body:
        "Fifa has been accused for a second time of failing to engage with concerns over human rights risks in Saudi Arabia, two months before the Gulf state is expected to be confirmed as a World Cup host.\n\nThe Building and Wood Workers’ International, a trade union that has worked with Fifa on governance reforms and previously signed a memorandum of understanding with the governing body, says it has been ignored in attempts to discuss the exploitation of foreign workers in Saudi.\n\nJavier Tebas (fourth right) alongside representatives from the Premier League, Belgium’s top flight and union chiefs from France, Italy and Norway at a press conference\nEurope’s leagues and Fifpro accuse Fifa of ‘abusive and anti-competitive’ acts\nRead more\nIn June the BWI submitted a complaint to the International Labour Organisation that claimed “an epidemic of abuses” against migrant workers in the Gulf kingdom. Among the examples cited was the case of thousands of Filipino workers who are said to be waiting for financial remedy from the Saudi state after they were denied wages, often over periods of years, by their former employers. The BWI says ­numerous subsequent requests to Fifa “to engage in dialogue about these abuses and to set stringent conditions for hosting” have not been taken up.\n\nAmbet Yuson, the BWI ­general secretary, sat on Fifa’s human rights advisory board until it was dissolved in 2020. He has accused Fifa of ­conducting a bidding process “without any robust assessment” and said awarding the World Cup to Saudi risked a “permanent stain” in the world of sport.\n\n“Rewarding Saudi Arabia with the 2034 Fifa World Cup without any robust assessment and any mechanisms in place to prevent further abuses, is to endorse exploitation and injustice on a global stage,” Yuson said.\n\n“Whilst no credible assessment of the Saudis’ human rights plans can be made without input from independent organisations on the ground, Fifa must immediately take responsibility and use its leverage to ensure justice for the thousands of workers who have been denied their most basic rights for more than a decade. The time for action is now – before any decision is finalised and injustice becomes a permanent stain in the world of sport.”\nThe BWI’s intervention comes less than two weeks after a group of leading lawyers said Fifa had failed to engage with them over a legal submission regarding human rights in the kingdom. The group, which included a former chair of Fifa’s independent governance committee, said the response was “simply not good enough” and argued Fifa was “­dealing with the devil” in taking the tournament to the kingdom.\n\nThe BWI’s complaint to the International Labour ­Organisation recorded human rights abuses against 21,000 migrant workers in Saudi Arabia, including workers from the Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh who have worked on building Saudi’s infrastructure.\n\nThe trade union says responses to complaints by the Saudi government have been slow. It cites the example of 8,830 Filipino workers at the now‑liquidated Saudi Oger company who went without wages, according to workers’ testimony, sometimes for years. The BWI says only 1,352 have been compensated for the losses and others have been forced to take out loans to cover household expenses.\nFifa is expected to confirm in December that Saudi Arabia, the only bidder, will win the right to host the 2034 World Cup. The global ­governing body is compiling “bid evaluation reports” that are to be published before the decision. One of the three central components of the evaluation is a “risk report” which, among other criteria, assesses sustainability and human rights.\n\nThe BWI argues that with trade unions and foreign ­non-­governmental organisations banned in Saudi Arabia it is vital for Fifa to take into account any submissions that give a picture of life on the ground in the country. Article 7 of Fifa’s human rights policy says: “Fifa will constructively engage with the relevant authorities and other stakeholders and make every effort to uphold its international human rights responsibilities.”\n\nFifa and the Saudi ministry of human resources and social ­development have been approached for comment.",
