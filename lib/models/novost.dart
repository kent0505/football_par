        "In the end, the Germans' eagerness to go on holiday changed history.\n\nTheir Euro 1976 final against Czechoslovakia was never meant to go to penalties.\n\nWest Germany - defending European champions, reigning World Cup winners - were heavy favourites.\n\nEven if Czechoslovakia held out through extra time, the initial plan had been for a replay two days later. Welsh referee Clive Thomas had been told to delay his return home from host nation Yugoslavia to cover the eventuality.\n\nA few hours before the match though, the plan changed.\n\n\"It was a request from the German Football Association,\" remembers Antonin Panenka.\n\n\"They said that their players had already booked some holidays, blah, blah, blah, and asked if penalties could be taken straight away instead of a replay.\"\n\nCzechoslovakia figured, as underdogs, they were more likely to prevail in a shoot-out than a second match, so they agreed.\n\nPanenka, an elegant, passing playmaker, mentally checked his plan once more.\n\nAll was in order. No alteration necessary, no doubt admitted.\n\nA ploy two years in the making that would make him famous and infamous, a hero and an enemy - whether it succeeded or not - was ready. Back home, Panenka had been involved in another, almost daily, penalty contest.\n\nAfter training at his Prague club side Bohemians, Panenka and goalkeeper Zdenek Hruska would stay behind to practise spot-kicks.\n\nIt was a very personal duel. Panenka would have five penalties - he would have to score all five, Hruska would have to save just one. Whoever lost would buy their post-training beer or chocolate.\n\n\"I was constantly paying him,\" says Panenka.\n\n\"So in the evenings I would think up ways to beat him - that's when I realised that as I ran up the goalkeeper would wait for the last second and then gamble, diving to the left or the right.\n\n\"I thought: 'What if I send the ball almost directly into the centre of the goal?'\"\n\nPanenka tried it. He found that introducing another possible penalty and some hesitation to Hruska's mind meant he was winning more, spending less and still getting his post-training treat.\n\nIt could have stopped there and remained a piece of unseen showboating. But Panenka realised his new technique was more than that. He had unearthed a legitimate 12-yard tactic.\n\nOver the next couple of years, he tested it on larger and larger stages. First, in training, then in friendlies and finally, the month before Euro 1976, against local rivals Dukla Prague in a competitive fixture.\n\nEach time it worked and his conviction grew.\n\n\"I made no secret of it,\" Panenka says.\n\n\"Here [in Czechoslovakia] people were well aware of it.\n\n\"But in western countries, in top football countries nobody was interested in Czechoslovak football at all.\n\n\"Maybe they were kept up with some results, but they didn't watch our games.\"\n\nSo, there was no laminated cheat sheet or whispered instructions from a backroom analyst for Sepp Maier.\n\nAs the West German goalkeeper crouched on his goalline and fixed his eyes on Panenka, he had only his own instincts to go on.\n\nMaier's team-mate Uli Hoeness had blazed the previous spot-kick over the bar. It was the first miss of the shoot-out, after extra time finished with the teams still locked together at 2-2.\n\nInstantly the stakes became sudden death and sky high. If Panenka scored, West Germany were beaten.\n\nPanenka's run-up was long and fast. He seemed intent, like Hoeness, on thumping his instep through the back of the ball.\n\nInstead, with the most important kick of his life, he fell back on his trusted trick. A deft tickle sent the ball floating down the centre of the goal. Panenka's arm was aloft in celebration before it hit the net. Maier, flummoxed and failing, scrambled back to his feet, but only in time to shoot a rueful look at Panenka wheeling away in celebration.\n\n\"None of us could believe we were European champions,\" said Panenka. \"It was like Alice in Wonderland.\"\n\nIt was just as surreal back in Prague. Their European Championship win came eight years after the Prague Spring - when a Soviet-led herd of tanks had rolled across the border and crushed attempts to loosen the country's communist system.\n\nSince then, large public gatherings had been rare, permitted only for orchestrated welcomes of foreign dignitaries. When the team arrived with Czechoslovakia though, there was no holding back the emotion or the numbers.\n\n\"Nobody expected that so many people would come to give us such a warm welcome,\" Panenka remembers.\n\n\"When some head of state came, the roads used to be lined with young people holding parade wands.\n\n\"But it was all sort of forced. This time though they all came spontaneously to greet us and show their appreciation. I had never experienced anything like that before. It was one of the best moments of my football career.\"\n\nPanenka's decisive, distinctive penalty made him centre of attention. Not just for the crowd, but for the authorities as well.\n\nCzechoslovakians had been subjected to a process dubbed 'normalisation' since their attempt to diverge from the Soviet model. The remoulding or removing of dissident elements had gone far beyond politics.\n\nJust three months before Euro 1976, Czechoslovakia's secret police had arrested a psychedelic rock band and other underground musicians, fearful that long hair and counter-cultural lyrics alone could fuel revolution.",
